    Your Telegram account may be banned.
    I'm not responsible for misuse of bot, responsibility belongs entirely to user.
    This bot is maintained for fun as well as managing groups efficiently.
    If you think you will have fun by spamming groups, you are wrong.
    In case of any spam ban, if you come and write that my account has been banned,
    I'll just laugh at you.
